A **fast** and **correct** HTTP implementation for Rust.

**Get started** by looking over the [guides](https://hyper.rs/guides).

## "Low-level"

hyper is a relatively low-level library, meant to be a building block for
libraries and applications.

If you are looking for a convenient HTTP client, then you may wish to consider
[reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest). If you are looking for a
convenient HTTP server, then you may wish to consider [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).
Both are built on top of this library.
